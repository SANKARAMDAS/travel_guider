Project Idea - It's a travel guider website(a perticular place which resturants/casino/tourist places are famous) will show to you all about that place and famous things.

Technology - ReactJs

How to run - Clone it > yarn > yarn start

Status - Unfinished.... Beacuse of the Google Maps JavaScript API, you have to add your Credit/Debit Card details. My Case my Bank are not giving me permission to validate with Google. 

Future Plan- At future if the problem resolved, I surely start over again. Just need the "Google Maps JavaScript API"
